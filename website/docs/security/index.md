Cloud security at AWS is the highest priority. Security is follows a "shared responsibility" model between AWS and you. When using a managed service like Amazon EKS, AWS is responsible for security "of" the cloud whereas you, the customer, are responsible for security "in" the cloud.

In this module, we'll explore various aspects of Amazon EKS related to security. To learn more about security with EKS, refer to the [EKS Best Practices Guide](https://aws.github.io/aws-eks-best-practices/security/docs/).
