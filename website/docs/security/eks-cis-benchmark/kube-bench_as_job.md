In this case, we are going to be running kube-bench as a k8s job.

```bash
$ kubectl apply -k /workspace/modules/security/kube-bench/base
```

Run the job in your cluster

```file
security/kube-bench/base/job.yaml
```

Pod would be in the `Completed` state as the job would have completed the scan.
```bash
$ kubectl get pods
NAME               READY   STATUS      RESTARTS   AGE
kube-bench-lvg24   0/1     Completed   0          2m24s
```

Check the logs of the pod to determine the results of the scan
```bash
$ kubectl logs kube-bench-lvg24

== Remediations node ==
3.2.9 If using a Kubelet config file, edit the file to set eventRecordQPS: to an appropriate level.
If using command line arguments, edit the kubelet service file
/etc/systemd/system/kubelet.service on each worker node and
set the below parameter in KUBELET_SYSTEM_PODS_ARGS variable.
Based on your system, restart the kubelet service. For example:
systemctl daemon-reload
systemctl restart kubelet.service
